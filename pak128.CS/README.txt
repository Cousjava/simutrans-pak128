This is source of pak128.CS. It includes everything to produce an usable package, except for the compiler program(s).


Compilation
-----------

Currently these build systems are available:
* pakmak.py
* Makefile
* Windows batch file

The first wants makeobj on path, the other two next to script file. Other requirements are, obviously, the backends: Python for pakmak, GNU make for Makefile and Windows for the batch file.

Result of compilation should be a directory "simutrans/pak128.CS", ready to be used.


License matters
---------------

When reusing the material from this set, observe the terms of used license. Additionally, please provide some attribution, although this is not mandatory.

The license implicitly assumed for all graphical material is "Artistic license 2.0", unless specified otherwise individually. For license details, please see the accompanying file "LICENSE.txt". Configuration, text and script files are in public domain, unless specified otherwise.


Sources and material
--------------------
You find some sources of our creation under "sources" folder. You find some unfinished creation under "material" folder, you can finish it.

Alternative forms of graphics
-----------------------------

Given how the source/compilation paradigm breaks when translated from "programming" to general data manipulation, the approach taken for our graphics is purely pragmatical.

Generally, user-level distribution form of material are compiled PAK files. Their sources are the PNG and DAT files available here, without exception. This fulfills at least the letter of the law of "being open source".

True "openess", however, suggests that the whole process should be replicable, which is not always possible. Still, in some cases, there are available initial or intermediate forms of material from which the graphics are rendered in some way. Providing these consistently is beyond the scope of this project, but encouraged. Folders or files that contain these usually contain "src" somewhere in their name.
