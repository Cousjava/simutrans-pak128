#  Forest related values Tomas Kubes
#  please be careful in changing them, I spent lot of time finding optimals.
#  those values have impact on no. of spwaned trees -> memory consumption
#
# Number of trees on square 2 - minimal usable, 3 good, 4 very nice looking
forest_no_of_trees_per_square = 3

# Base forest size - minimal size of forest - map independent
forest_base_size = 36

# Map size divisor - smaller it is the larger are individual forests
forest_map_size_divisor = 38

# Forest count divisor - smaller it is, the more forest are generated
forest_count_divisor = 16

# Forest boundary sharpenss: 0 - perfectly sharp boundaries, 20 - very blurred
forest_boundary_blur = 10

# Forest boundary thickness  - determines how thick will the boundary line be
forest_boundary_thickness = 2

# Determins how dense are spare trees going to be planted (works inversly)
forest_inverse_spare_tree_density = 400
