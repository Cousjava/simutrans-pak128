pakTTD
======

About this part of the project:

pakTTD is an attempt to combine the Simutrans engine with non-copyrighted (Open)TTD graphics. At best, this will result in a look like OpenTTD (which uses other colors and shadow definitions) with the other vehicle and goods routing of Simutrans. Also this will serve as an example pak, since currently there is no pak completely with GPL or similar "free" graphics and thus no freely available examples.
