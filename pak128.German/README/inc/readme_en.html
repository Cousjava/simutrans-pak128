<h5>Miscellaneous:</h5>
<p>PAK128.german is a graphic set for the transportsimulation Simutrans. It offers the player the opportunity to build a transport system whose presentation is based on typical german cities and industries. The timeline, also known as chronology, takes the historical background into account. In terms of vehicles and that of the industrial chains, without claiming complete realism.</p>
<p>Trains and vehicles are thereby a bit bigger than those from the Standard-Pak 128. Most buildings, regardless of city or industry, have consistently four views. Every building- and factory type has furthermore based on the region in which it is, a different graphic, and in the latter different operation numbers of production.</p>
<p>To enjoy the diversity of the set, we suggest to take a look in the <a href="spieltipps_en.html" class="tips">Game tips</a>.</p>
