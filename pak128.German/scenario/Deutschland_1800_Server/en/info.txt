<br> <em> Royal Proclamation </em>
<br> <br>
King Martin I of Simutransia gives concessions for the establishment of transport companies to everyone who can raise the necessary start-up capital of 2 million thalers. Fortunately, getting the money is not a problem. There are enough investors who, as silent partners, provide the necessary capital. On the other hand, it is more difficult to find brave, hard-working and capable people who dare to build such a company and lead it to economic success
Since a transport company is a natural monopoly and to protect its underling from excessive prices, the king had the prices for tickets and transport fees set uniformly by law for all transport companies. The prices are reasonable. No matter whether passenger transport or goods transport, with a reasonable choice of means of transport and infrastructure, every line should be profitable to operate
King Martin hopes that the transport companies will work together for the benefit of his underlings. Use the technical progress looming on the horizon of the future. Let the country blooming and the economy growing. <br>
That arduous, dangerous and time-consuming travel is a thing of the past. <br>
That the miserable supply of cities has come to an end and not all citizens have to go to their workplaces on foot.
<br>
If a transport operator burns out with the till and does not return within 10 years at the latest, the king allows the company to be taken over by another brave and capable player. <br>
The king does not like to see when players open up cities and use them to occupy cities, but the means of transport are completely inadequate. The king has met subjects who have spent their entire lives waiting at the bus stop. Some have been waiting for a ride for 100 years or more. The king welcomes when in such cases other entrepreneurs take care of the waiting masses and bring them to their destination. <br>
<br>
The king wishes entrepreneurs success, growth, size, wealth and social advancement.
