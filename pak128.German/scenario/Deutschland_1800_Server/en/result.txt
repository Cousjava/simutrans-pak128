You can still play today. <br>
<br>
The timeline ends in 2030, after which innovations are no longer expected. <br> <br>
Since the game gets more boring from about 2100. The players drown normally in the money. The cities and actually the whole map have grown uncontrollably large. The passengers and quantities of goods, even by hard-working players, can hardly be handled. <br>
From 2100 comes the time in which the server is restarted with the year 1800. <br>
The latest version of the card is then normally available for download at https://pak128-german.de/inc/savegames.html. If you want, you can continue playing afterwards, but locally and for yourself.
<br>
With the restart from 1800 there will be a tie again for everyone. <br> The cities are small again. <br> The roads are bad. <br> The factories are rare and money is scarce. <br>
<br>
I will try to announce the restart a week in advance.
