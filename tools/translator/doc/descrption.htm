SimuTranslator will be web based application (referred as application or
SimuTranslator later on in this text), which should support Simutrans
translators by providing them comfortable user interface for creation of
translations for the program objects and Simutrans developers by providing them
with simple means for management of the translations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The
SimuTranslator should read the definitions of all existing Simutrans scenario
specific objects along with their properties and sample images and store them in
its own database. This operation will be available for administrators only and
possible object entries already existing in the application database will be
overwritten by new ones without asking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The
application should be able to read exiting translation files (*.tab files) and
store their content (translation of object names) in own database. Each object
name will have one unique translation for each language and scenario. If the
file, containing the translation entries for the objects which already have
existing translation in application database is loaded, application should offer
multiple means for resolving the conflicts, namely: replace all entries by new
ones, replace all old entries which were not modified after certain date,
replace all entries modified by this author, and display all conflicting entries
and manually select which version of translation to preserve while allowing
manual modification (to allow author merging of both versions). Application will
also remove possible breaks (\n) while loading the file.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">In the
translation interface, the application should be able to display all objects one
by one with their properties, sample image, possible reservation (with the name
of its holder), existing translations in other languages, translation suggestion
for this language, and the text input box for inputting the translation. Images
and complete object information should not be displayed to translators who have
not agreed with image set copyright policies. Translator should be able to
choose which information he wants to see in this window in preferences. He
should be also able to choose which object he wants to see: all, only
untranslated, only specified category.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">Translators
should be able to reserve some object names or object name groups for future
offline translation and get the list of these objects. Import of new translation
entries will be solved by .tab file import facilities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
SimuTranslator will be able to output translation files for Simutrans,
respecting all formatting requirements and including file description head. It
should also be able to output lists of untranslated entries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">Application
will recognize three user groups: object administrators who shall be able to
import objects, mange objects, create new languages, manage other users, and
have access to all translations; translators will be associated with some
translations (eventually scenarios) and will have full access to those
translations; guest will be random visitors, they will be able to view only
basic object data and translations, but they will be only able to modify
translation suggestions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">Unlimited
number of object scenarios and languages should be supported. Application
interface will be in English.</span></td>
