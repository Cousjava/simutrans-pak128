#  Forest related values Tomas Kubes
#  please be careful in changing them, I spent lot of time finding optimals.
#  those values have impact on no. of spwaned trees -> memory consumption
#
# Number of trees on square 2 - minimal usable, 3 good, 5 very nice looking
max_no_of_trees_on_square = 10

# Base forest size - minimal size of forest - map independent
forest_base_size = 36

# Map size divisor - smaller it is the larger are individual forests
forest_map_size_divisor = 32

# Forest count divisor - smaller it is, the more forest are generated
forest_count_divisor = 16

# Forest boundary sharpenss: 0 - perfectly sharp boundaries, 20 - very blurred
forest_boundary_blur = 7

# Forest boundary thickness  - determines how thick will the boundary line be
forest_boundary_thickness = 2

# Determins how dense are spare trees going to be planted (works inversly)
forest_inverse_spare_tree_density = 384

# climate with trees entirely (1: water, 2:desert, 4:tropic, 8:mediterran, 16:temperate, 32:tundra, 64:rocky, 128:arctic)
# zero (default) means no climate with at least one tree per tile
tree_climates = 36
# 36 = 32 + 4 = tundra,tropic

# climates with no trees at all (desert and arctic at the moment)
no_tree_climates = 128
