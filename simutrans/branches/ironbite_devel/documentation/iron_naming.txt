Simutrans Iron Bite Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------

I know there are myriads of places which do not comply 
to this convention. This is because this convention was
written when Simutrans already was 12 years in 
development and many of the developers did not know/did
not care about an older convention which had been written
for Simutrans Standard.

New code should be written with this in mind, though.

Default Variable Names
